# Clicker game

## turn-based game. 2 players will take turns with clicking a button.
## will you my artwork as icons to track players turn
## would love to have two different game modes (click sprint and marathon)
## click sprint will be 5 seconds time
## marathod will be 30 seconds time
## the space bar will be the trigger button and keep track of the counter
## I will place some kind of timer within the game to let you know when the game is over
## there will be a turn base moment and allow each player to set up and prepare to click the space bar. depending on the mode you click. you will have 30 seconds or 5 seconds to hit the space bar as fast a possible until time runs out. whoever has the highest amount of clicks wins the game...

## char. based off the amount of clicks. the image changes. 
## game mode. sprint (both players reach a number)

# idea #2
## thinking of a game where you pick the path you take (butterfly effect)
## in this game, you will have two people playing and choosing which path you would like to change. depending on the part of the story... and what you and your friend chose will change the overall story. 
## this will be a text based game with images
## if you and your friend comes to a disagreement within voting. you both will have to rock paper scissors in order for your story to win. (best of 2) and once that player wins, they will get a tag. this tag will keep track and let you remember who was the one who picked that said path. 
 <!-- do func of rock, paper, scissors first. -->
